                AskLlama is an artificial intelligence program that doesn’t take
                itself too seriously. Hope you don't too 🙂 🙃

              <li>
                As much as we love our AskLlama characters, they are not the
                originals but only representations. Don't worry though, they
                still have all the personality and charm of the original Masters
                😎
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                AskLlama responses are for informational purposes only and
                should not be treated as sage advice. So, if you're looking to
                quit your job and become a llama herder because of something we
                said, maybe double check with an actual professional first.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                AskLlama may occasionally provide inaccurate information or use
                humour (our best quality obviously) that may not be everyone’s
                cup of tea.
              </li>

              <br />
              <p>
                Ask away, but don't sue us if it gets sassy! We're just a bunch
                of llamas trying to make your day a little brighter!
